Tickets is a productivity app that helps teams keep track of tasks. 

### Assign status, owner, priority, and schedule.
- Let everyone know at a glance the ticket progress, who is responsible, and how urgent it is.

### Easily add subscribers and tags.
- Want a team member kept in the loop? Add them to the subscribed section so that the ticket shows up in their Sunscribed folder. 

- Need to filter your tickets by custom categories? This is what tags are for.
